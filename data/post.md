## This is the new way to Write things in the Bunny Blog

We have struggled in the past with the blog, the blog:
1. contains errors.
1. difficult to maintain.
1. **Engineers don't have time.**

By doing this:
* Allow marketing to create content in a faster.
* No dependence from engineering.
* Styles are the same accross the platform.
* Traffic runs through Bunny and not 3rd party page.
